# Data Collection Overview

## FieldAgent on iOS <a href="#fieldagent_on_ios" id="fieldagent_on_ios"></a>

1. Download and login to FieldAgent on an iPhone or iPad.
2. From the main screen, tap the drone <img src="https://support.sentera.com/galleryDocuments/edbsn3ce429149d1793ef1d5d29ff093d3d9a51dce7cb41943c257380c9029cffb903e0edec391709b08cadb01d6984543de1?inline=true" alt="" data-size="line"> icon to begin flight planning. Browse to the area you would like to collect imagery of by using the background satellite map.
3. Long press (press down and hold for 1 second) on the map to place a corner of the flight area
4. Continue long pressing on the map in the corners of the flight boundary in a clockwise direction.
5. Click in the box labeled Presets
6. Choose from the list of presets.
   1. Stand and Tassel Counts - These option sets the overlap to -300%, as the flight plan will collect a sampling of stand counts from throughout the field. Every plant in every photo is counted, but every plant in the field is not captured in a photo). Ensure the boundary does not overlap trees. If necessary, alter the Boundary Buffer or flight boundary to plan a safe flight.\
      Note: A tassel must have at least two strands to receive accurate tassel counts.
   2. Early/Late Scouting/Maps - These options will all produce a map of the flight area.\
      Late/Early refers to the time in the season (Early Season vs. Late Season). Late season will fly higher than early season, as less detail is generally required as the plants become larger.\
      Scout/Map dictates if the resulting images can be processed as stitched mosaic. Stitching requires longer flight time and significantly longer processing time after the drone lands. [QuickTile vs. Stitched Mosaic](faqs/faqs-quicktile-vs-stitched-mosaic.md)
