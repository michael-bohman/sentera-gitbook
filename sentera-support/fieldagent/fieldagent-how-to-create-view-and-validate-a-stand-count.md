# FieldAgent - How to Create, View and Validate a Stand Count

FieldAgent Stand Counts allow you to efficiently and effectively capture population counts on every acre of your operation – processing images from throughout a field to identify every plant in every image for the most accurate and complete results. Currently supported crops are Corn, Soybeans, Cotton, and Potato.

The Validation Box is only available on FieldAgent Web.\
