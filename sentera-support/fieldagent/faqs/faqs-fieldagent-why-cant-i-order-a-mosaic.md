# FAQS - FieldAgent - Why Can't I Order a Mosaic?

To order a full mosaic after importing images into FieldAgent, go into the imported survey date and click the gear icon. You should see an option to order a mosaic. If you don't, the field is not fully synced with the cloud servers. &#x20;

**Confirm the Field is Synced:**

1. In the Field View screen, click the Field Details button in the lower right corner.
2. View Status to determine if the field is Partially Synced or Synced.

**If the Field is Partially Synced:**

1. Click the Sync button in the top right-hand corner of FieldAgent and let it finish syncing.
2. Check the Status in Field Details again.
3. If the Status is now Synced, you should be able to order a mosaic.
4. If the Status isn't Synced, try the Sync button again and repeat steps 2 and 3.
