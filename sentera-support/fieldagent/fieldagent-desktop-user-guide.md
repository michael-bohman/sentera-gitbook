### NDVI Histogram Chart <a href="#ndvi_histogram_chart" id="ndvi_histogram_chart"></a>

FieldAgent takes the survey data provided by the camera and computes a graph of all the reflectance values. This graph is a histogram, where the X axis is the NDVI value ranging from -1 to 1, and where the Y axis represents acreage. Just by mouse hovering over the graph, the general status of a field can be determined  when the low, high, and acres popup  displays, as shown in the following figure. The healthiest fields have graphs weighted to the right, where less healthy fields are weighted towards the center or left.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (396).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><mark style="color:blue;">Figure: Field Status</mark></p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Endpoint Adjustment <a href="#endpoint_adjustment" id="endpoint_adjustment"></a>

FieldAgent allows users to tailor the visible range of the NDVI data through two endpoint sliders below the graph. Users may set the range desired for color mapping by adjusting the position of the sliders. Only the data inside the range of this slider is color mapped. Data outside the range is colored black and omitted from the set. This is useful for studying fields that might border roads, or fields that have crops at different maturity levels. For example, roads generally have NDVI values of less than -.7. By adjusting the left slider to -.6, the roads are omitted from the color map, which is now distributed from -.6 to 1.

#### **Endpoint Slider**

Click and drag the endpoint slider to add or omit various items from the field.

1. Drag either end, or both ends,  to omit items such as roads, ponds, treelines or grass , as shown in the following figure.

### Color Map <a href="#color_map" id="color_map"></a>

FieldAgent offers four different colored maps that can be applied to NDVI data, as shown in Figure 120. Sometimes, the human eye can perceive differences in blues that may not be readily apparent in greens and reds. Experiment with different settings to see what works best for your eye.

\
<img src="https://img.zohostatic.com/zde/static/images/file.png" alt="" data-size="line"> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Note:  The color map adjusts how the data is colored; it does not change the calculations or statistics of the data. Unless you change it back to Red to Green, it remains the color selected.</mark>

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (400).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><mark style="color:blue;">Figure: Color Map</mark></p></figcaption></figure></div>

### Run and View Analytics <a href="#run_and_view_analytics" id="run_and_view_analytics"></a>

In FieldAgent you can run analytics on a variety of data. It is important that the data was collected correctly for analytic tools to run against the data. This is performed by selecting the appropriate map product in the FieldAgent Mobile App. These map products eliminate the guess work and increase the likelihood of successful data collection which results in complete and accurate analytics maps. These maps are best collected on row crops in early season when the corn is at V2 or higher, and there are at least two-inch leaves on crops other than corn.
