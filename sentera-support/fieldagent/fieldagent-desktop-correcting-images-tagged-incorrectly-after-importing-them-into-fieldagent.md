# FieldAgent Desktop - Correcting Images Tagged Incorrectly after Importing them into FieldAgent

Images are tagged as RGB or no QuickTile when FieldAgentâ„¢ cannot locate certain metadata files generated by the Sentera sensor. These files identify the sensor to FieldAgent as an NDVI, NDRE, Multispectral, or other non-visual sensors.

To correct this problem, re-import from the folder containing the images and accompanying files. If you copy the images to a PC or network drive prior to importing them into FieldAgent, be sure to copy the entire contents of the folder to that drive, not just the JPG, PNG, or TIF files.

To delete a survey with incorrectly identified imagery, click the gear next to the survey date to be deleted, select Delete, and then follow the prompts.
