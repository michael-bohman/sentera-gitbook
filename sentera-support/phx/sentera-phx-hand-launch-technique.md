# Sentera PHX - Hand Launch Technique

## Launch Technique <a href="#launch_technique" id="launch_technique"></a>

_**Always launch the aircraft into the wind.  Only a slight crosswind component is allowed.**_&#x20;

_**Never launch your Sentera PHX™ with a tailwind.**_

1. Hold the aircraft wings level above your head. &#x20;
2. Point the nose straight toward or just above the horizon. &#x20;
3. Shake the aircraft forward once to start the motor. &#x20;
4. Take 1 step forward to gain momentum and then firmly push the aircraft straight forward **without stopping.** You will need to push the aircraft harder than the propeller is pulling to launch successfully.&#x20;
5. If the aircraft does not detect flight after 2 seconds the motor will stop as a safety precaution, so be sure to push the aircraft forward to launch immediately after the motor starts.
6. In zero wind a more vigorous push or jog will be necessary to gain enough airspeed for a successful launch. &#x20;
7. Always launch with a >95% full battery for maximum launch thrust.



<mark style="background-color:red;">WARNING: Be sure to keep hands and all other body parts away from the propeller at all times.  When launching DO NOT pull back the aircraft in a manner that causes the propeller to come near your face, hair, and/or any other part of your body.</mark>\
